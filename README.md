FuntanaCode
===========
This repository contains code for the Funtana project.

The files are structured as follows
  - All header(.h) files go into include/
  - All source(.c) fiies go into src/

The makefile is programmed to put all the .o files into obj/

NOTE: The obj folder on this remote repo is only a place holder. Do not
add/commmit/push .o files into your local repository or this remote repository. 
We do not need to track changes in the .o files
